There are those who wish to view genomes (bo-RING!) and then there are those who
wish to _explore_ them.

## Requirements

- Ruby 2.1.2
- Postgres
- The desire to explore the world of bacterial genomes
- A computer

## Quickstart

Using Ruby 2.1.2 and PostgreSQL 9.3

```sh
# with Ruby 2.1.2 and Bundler
bundle install

bundle exec rake db:setup
bundle exec rackup
```

## Continuous Integration and Deployment

Any push to the `master` branch of this GitHub repository will first be tested
using Travis-CI and then, if tests pass, deployed to genome.austinfanclub.com
via dokku.
