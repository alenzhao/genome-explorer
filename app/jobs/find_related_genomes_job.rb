# this job builds the entire genomes graph from scratch based on the entire
# features graph.
#
# It needs to be altered to accept a list of features to build a graph from.
# Alternatively, I could query the database to only use feature relationships
# created after a certain time. `created_at` gets filled in before the
# transaction ends so this is possible.
