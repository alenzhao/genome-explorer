#
# this module is poorly named. It should be called something like GraphViewer or
# GraphLense as it isn't really constructing a graph but providing different
# representations of the GenomeRelationship table.
#
# This could also be generalized to provide views of the FeatureRelationship
# table.
#
# This module could be modified to provide different lenses on relationships
# tables.
#
# I should read a few books on design patterns and rails
